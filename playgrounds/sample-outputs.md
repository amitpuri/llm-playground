4. Implementation Roadmap

Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up FastMCP client infrastructure
- Implement basic GitHub and PostgreSQL connectors
- Create meta-agent orchestration framework
- Establish monitoring and logging systems

Phase 2: Core Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement multi-agent coordination protocol
- Add difficulty-aware filtering system
- Integrate adaptive learning mechanisms
- Performance optimization and caching

Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Real-time recommendation engine
- User feedback integration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Production deployment and scaling

5. Gap Analysis & Research Opportunities

Identified Gaps:
1. Multi-MCP Orchestration: No existing research on coordinating multiple MCP servers
2. Real-Time Research Recommendations: Limited work on GitHub-integrated paper recommendations
3. Difficulty-Aware Filtering: Absence of complexity-based recommendation systems
4. Adaptive MCP Workflows: No frameworks for learning-based MCP coordination

Proposed Research Directions:
1. "Adaptive Multi-Agent MCP Orchestration" - Formal framework for coordinating multiple MCP servers
2. "Context-Aware Research Paper Difficulty Assessment" - Models assessing paper complexity relative to project requirements
3. "Real-Time Literature Review Generation" - Combining GNN-based matching with LLM summarization
4. "Federated Research Knowledge Graphs" - Distributed system connecting GitHub projects with research papers
